Normalization log
=================

Decisions & policies:
- ISBNs preserved as strings; leading zeros kept; no int casts.
- Prefer ISBN-13 as primary when present; otherwise use ISBN-10.
- Missing author -> book_authors row with empty author_id (interpreted as NULL).
- Rows missing both ISBN10 and ISBN13 saved to bad_books_rows.csv.
- Author identity = exact spelling; no fuzzy merges.
